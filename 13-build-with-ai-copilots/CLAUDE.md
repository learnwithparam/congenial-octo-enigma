# Build with AI Copilots

## Project Overview
This is a TypeScript learning project for practicing AI-assisted development workflows.
The codebase contains utility functions that students will refactor, debug, and extend using AI tools.

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript 5.x with ESM modules
- Node.js 20+
- tsx for development

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — Run the demo script with hot reload
- `npx tsc` — Type-check the project
- `npm test` — Run tests (when added)

## Project Structure
- `src/index.ts` — Main demo script with utility functions
- `lessons/` — Course lesson materials

## Coding Conventions
- Use explicit TypeScript types (no `any`)
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use ESM imports with `.js` extensions for relative paths
- Functions should be pure when possible
- Add JSDoc comments to exported functions
